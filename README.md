# Experiments with swarms
## Swarm 1

This script provides an implementation of the PSO algorithm with a teleportation mechanism. It offers flexibility to set various parameters and visualizes the optimization process in real-time.

## Swarm 2
This script simulates the collective motion of agents based on specific rules for repulsion, flocking, self-propulsion, and random forces. The simulation can be visualized using Pygame or can be run in a headless mode, storing the data for further analysis.

## Swarm 3
The script demonstrates a simple 2D grid navigation problem solved through a Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) trained using reinforcement learning (RL). The GRN simulates genes whose states (Q-values) change based on RL principles to guide an agent through a grid while avoiding obstacles. The environment is visualized using the Pygame library.

Details are described in specific swarm README files.
